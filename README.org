* DRLib
=drlib is a work in progress, no warrenty is given :)=

** What is drlib
drlib is a library with basic functions for use in [[https://dragonruby.itch.io/][DragonRuby]]. 

** Functions
- Point
- Rect

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC Ruby
# A point consists of an x and y coordinate:
p1 = Point.new(3, 2)
p2 = Point.new(9, 7)

# you can use to points to calculate the distance beween
# the two of them
p1.distance_to(p2) # => 7.2102


# A rectangle consists of 2 points, top left and bottom right:
r1 = Rect.new(100, 100, 300, 300)
r2 = REct.new(200, 200, 400, 400)

# You can check if rectangles intersect:
r1.intersects?(r2) # => true

# when you create a rectangle it generates a random color
# for itself. You can change that by changing the r, g, and b 
# variables

# A rectangle has a function to display itself in DragonRuby,
# please not that it is better to use sprites for graphics

args.outputs.solids << r1.solid

#+END_SRC
